      Your credit card will be billed monthly at the $9.00 per month rate unless you cancel your Premium Membership.

    <p>
      Premium Membership allows you to create Private Wikis in addition to the Public Wikis you can already create as a Basic Member.  Private Wikis will only be accessible by you, and any other user that you designate as a Collaborator.
